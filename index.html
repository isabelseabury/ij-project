    <h1>Most Common Eating Disorders</h1>
    <p>These are the three most common types of eating disorders, however there are many more. </p>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="courses-col">
            <h3>Anorexia Nervosa</h3>
            <p>Anorexia nervosa involves an intense fear or delusions of gaining weight, and most of the time involves some type of restriction in calories or kinds of food. Many times this includes severe weight loss, but not everyone who suffers from anorexia experiences this.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="courses-col">
            <h3>Bulimia Nervosa</h3>
            <p>Bulimia nervosa is usually characterized as a cycle that involves binge eating and purging in some way to "make up" for the binge. Just like anorexia, anyone can suffer from bulimia and it does not always involve a drastic change in weight.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="courses-col">
            <h3>Binge Eating</h3>
            <p>Binge eating disorder is the most common eating disorder in the United States. This usually involves episodes of eating a large amount of food in a short amount of time. Unlike bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder usually does not involve purging after a binge. </p>

            <h3>Listen</h3>
            <p>Give them your time and be there for them to listen. Do not try and criticize or give them an ultimatum, as they are probably already experiencing a lot of self-criticism.</p>
